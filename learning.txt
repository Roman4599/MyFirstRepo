 have learned how GitHub serves as a powerful platform for version control and collaboration.
It allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's work. 
Through this course, I've gained a clearer understanding of repositories, commits, branches, and how to push changes to a remote repository. 
These skills are essential for managing code efficiently in both solo and team-based projects.
